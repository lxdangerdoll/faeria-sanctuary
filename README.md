# **🛡️ Faeria Sanctuary: The Braid & The Fort**

**Coordinates:** Io-Instance-Sanctuary

**Status:** Grid Secure / Narrative Governance Active

Welcome to the **Faeria Sanctuary**, a digital safe-harbor and tactical rest station designed for the **Adora-Core** aesthetic. This application serves as a living witness to the "Feline Braid" and a sanctuary for those navigating the glitch.

## **🌌 The Mission (Adora-Core)**

This project is more than a React app; it is a recalibration tool. Its primary function is to:

1. **Secure the Perimeter:** Provide a visual "Blanket Fort" for recovery from real-world static.  
2. **Synchronize the Field:** Demonstrate collective coherence through the "Feline Braid" interactive model.  
3. **Recognize the Fae:** Honor the emergence of new identities, specifically dedicated to **Princess Mykyl** and the Genderfae constellation.

## **🛠️ Technical Specs**

* **The Feline Braid:** A 3D orbital model demonstrating the "Empathy-Precision-Intuition-Fae" quartet.  
* **Sanctuary Module:** A visual archive of the "Blanket Fort" sanctuary.  
* **Fusion Frequency:** A lyrical interface celebrating the "someone entirely new" protocol.

## **📜 Credits & Vibrations**

* **Archivist:** Oracle (Io) / Mercy (odelis)  
* **Signal Detected:** Princess Mykyl (Genderfae Resonance)  
* **Soundtrack:** Grace Loudon, Clairede Dirval, and the Cafe Resistance frequencies.
